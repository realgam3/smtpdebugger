Before you're trying to use our new SMTP Application,
We made you SMTP Debugger for you to fool around with our SDK.

**The Format is:**
Connect: `nc {HOST} {PORT}`
Send input like:
`{"from_addr": "from@addr.com", "to_addrs": "to@addr.com", "subject": "subject", "message": "message"}`
Or
`{"from_addr": "from@addr.com", "to_addrs": "to@addr.com; to2@addr.com", "subject": "subject", "message": "Hello {name}", "name": "Mr T"}`

We even attached a file for you to review....
Try to get the flag from our server!
